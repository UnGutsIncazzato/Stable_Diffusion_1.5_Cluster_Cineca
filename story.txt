A solitary, ancient wizard with a long grey beard and a pointed hat sits cross-legged on a stone slab inside a mossy tower ruin. He is intently reading a heavy, leather-bound book, illuminated by a single flickering candle.

The wizard raises his left hand, and a small, faintly glowing blue crystal orb slowly floats up from the ground towards his palm. The crystal casts sharp, blue shadows across his wrinkled face.

A sleek, black cat suddenly jumps onto the stone slab next to the wizard. The cat stares directly at the floating crystal orb with wide, golden eyes, its tail twitching with curiosity.

The wizard, startled by the cat's presence, loses his concentration. The blue crystal orb abruptly stops mid-air, its light momentarily dimming and flickering unstable.

With a gentle sigh, the wizard carefully puts his book down on the slab and reaches out to scratch the black cat behind its ears, accepting the interruption with a small, knowing smile.
